# Retail-Like-GUI
Retail-Like GUI that works on 3.3.5a Client.


This GUI is not made by me (OMGhixD) but merely is a collection of addons i've downloaded across the web. I've carried out some fixes here and there to improve it. But i take no credit for the creation of this. Just for the collectivity of it. It is released to the public and available in various locations.

Installation Guide.

1.) Download latest from https://github.com/RevelationWoW/Retail-Like-GUI/releases/

2.) Copy all content to YourWoWClient/Interface/AddOns

3.) Open Wow.exe, login and confirm through Addon tab on character selection that it all installed correctly.

Notice: You might have to tick "Load out of date AddOns"

Enjoy!

Good to know commands:

/rui edit - Allows you to edit the UI layout. Type the command again to save.
